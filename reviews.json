That worked just beautifully on my sensitive skin and combined w/ the smart line of moisturizers, I had my skin care routine down. The addition of Retinol A did it for me. My skin is way too sensitive for this ingredient and now, I am left w/out a serum option from Clinique. I don't want to try another product by a different vendor because Clinique's products are made to work well together, so now I don't know what I am going to do. I just hate it when Clinique discontinues a product and offers a sub-par new product in its place. This seems to be more and more common w/ Clinique now-a-days, and it gets so frustrating. Why on  earth would you add such an ingredient knowing that so  many people cannot use a product that has Retinol A in it and not provide an option w/out Retinol A? Ever heard of user acceptance testing before you discontinue one product for another?",

This Clinique  Smart Clinical Repair  Wrinkle Correcting Serum  ( the entire line ) is actually the best one for sensitive skin yet effective with visible results. I have stocked up that will last me for for a year or so. This is how much I love this product. My o my complaint is how I wish these products are sealed to ensure integrity of the product. I would buy online and receive bottles that are either half full of or 3/4 full never really a full bottle. So at time I would prefer purchasing from a physical boutique so I could check first. Otherwise product works great on my skin!",

My pores quadrupled in size, filling up with whatever gunk they could find!  Terrible!  I tried many different products, most being too thick and immediately causing pimples; some too thin, leaving no benefits and only dry skin.  Clinique was lovingly recommended and I, begrudgingly, ordered this serum.  How fortunate I feel that I not only found a good serum that fulfills all promises but a whole line of skin care.  This serum is great and the skin care line has changed my life.  It's been like putting a shammy on my face that absorbs all crud.  This has been an amazing experience...after washing, I use the #2 astringent before I apply the serum.  After serum, I apply the broad spectrum moisturizer with sunscreen, and then I'm ready to go!  Since I began this twice-daily routine about four months ago, I've seen no heads, black or white, and overall, my skin has improved dramatically.  It's like this serum does it all, it's amazing!!  Thank you clinique for making this old lady feel good about the skin she's in again!!!",

Sometimes this is normal when using a retinol product (would have been nice if the percentage was disclosed so I knew the potency before purchasing...the highest I have gone so far is 0.25% therefore if it is closer to 1% people should know before taking the risk of a reaction) I started by using it once a week and every time after the reaction would get worse. I had full body hives and needed to take allergy medicine for it to go away. Now I don't know what to do with it but I certainly cannot use it anymore.",

Went to Clinique counter  explaned what happened and hey gave me a sample of this and same thing I broke out.  The only serum I have not tried and I won't try because you are discontinuing is Repairwear laser focus.

I've \"upped\" my various skin care as I've gotten older and since I loved the Custom Repair Serum, (and can't find it through Clinique any longer), I decided to try this new Clinical Repair Serum.  First, it has a very medicinal smell to it. Clinique products don't have fragrance, which is one thing I love about them. This serum did just the opposite of what I expected.  Not only was it drying, after two uses I ended up with several small dry patches, (red and painful), on my face.  Why yet again, do you take a wonderful product like the Custom Repair Serum and \"improve\" it with an even more expensive product that not only doesn't work, but is actually harmful.   I plan on finding my receipt and returning it.  Very disappointed.",

I refuse to try this because I've been fooled too many times trying to like everything else that Clinique replaces just to be extremely disappointed. Instead of wasting my money on C. R. A. P., I'll just buy something elsewhere because I'm done with Clinique. Don't bother with your dumb response to this review \"... discontinued favorites are not done impulsively or without a great deal of research...\" as I've gotten it many times. Products get discontinued because you can make worse products cheaper and charge more for the so-called new and improved. Ughhhh.",

The immediate effects are SMOOTH and SOFT skin so I tried using this in AM to prep my skin for a flawless makeup look and it did not pill. When used in the PM, I woke up with my skin looking more rested than usual despite how many hours I slept. I have this wrinkle that bothers me so much that I obsess over and it looked more relaxed. I stopped using all other serums in my skincare to give this a fair and honest review. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I would have loved to have longer time with more product to truly test the results on the wrinkle. I will purchase this now after trying it!! Overall: Wrinkles appeared to be more relaxed. Super smooth and super soft skin!",

I kept up with the application and took a picture of myself every 5 days. During the two weeks, I didn't feel any dryness or discomfort.

While it didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause any irritation, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t really see any difference for my fine lines or the texture on my skin. There might be a slight bounciness, but maybe only because I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m really trying to see something. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know if a prolonged usage would result into more apparent results. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll keep using it and see if anything changes.",

It looked like I'd aged 20 years overnight. What's worse is that since I stopped using the product, my face has been painful to the touch and a few days later my skin began to peel. A non-prescription retinol product should not cause so much irritation. I have tried twice to return over Clinique's Live Chat, but I have not yet been sent a return label despite promises from the representatives that they would email me one within 48 hours.

It almost immediately makes your skin feel moisturized and very smooth to the touch. It almost feels like there is a built-in primer in this product. There is no noticeable scent which I really appreciate. My skin does look better after applying this product but I can't really say I have seen a huge difference in my skin over the past two weeks. This product cannot be used around the eye area and unfortunately, that is where most of my wrinkles are. I was hoping to see improvements on my forehead and around my jaw area. When the product is first applied my wrinkles do seem diminished, but as soon as I wash my face in the morning or remove my makeup at the end of the day, my sad wrinkes are back.",

I used that at night and in the morning woke up with smooth skin. I cannot say anything about wrinkles and even fine lines as 10 ml of the trial size was not enough to see any results in that, but it did moisturize pretty well and absorbed very quick. Yes, I'd recommend this serum to my relatives and friends as a good moisturizer, as, unfortunately, didn't receive enough product of that to have any thoughts on wrinkles or fine lines correcting.",

There was a slight burning sensation around the crows feet area of my eyes which wasn't unpleasant and made me feel it was having some effect in plumping up fine lines. After only two weeks I felt it lessened the fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes. I used it around the mouth area and lower cheeks as well and noticed some improvement which I think would become more pronounced with regular use.

I have felt some burning and irritation whilst using it but I found I was mixing actives o my skin seems to be okay now. I didn't experience any flaking of the skin like I have with some Retinol products. I have fine lines and I think their is a slight improvement but nothing to get too excited about yet. I would need to continue to use the product to see the longer term results. I have dry skin so I would need to use a thick moisturiser or a hydrating serum with this serum as it's just so mattifying. Overall its a nice serum but only using it for a short period hasn't seen a lot of results.",

It helps accelerate your skin\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s natural cell renewal to speed up bringing fresh skin cells to the surface. It also helps shed dull surface skin to visibly reduce the appearance of wrinkles. I noticed a difference after 4 days. That's quick!! 2. Hyaluronic Acid Concentrate: This is a MAJOR key to Instantly hydrating and plumping your skin. It also helps restore suppleness and volume to diminish the appearance of fine, dry lines. NOT kidding......I noticed a major difference after 10 days!!! 3. NO Oil, denatured alcohol, SLS, SLES, sulfates, parabens, phthalates, or fragrance. Just a pure Clean Serum to make you look your best! It's now my Go-To! You won't be disappointed!!!",

After a week I started using once a day and loving it more and more, . My skin looks bright , I was just with ladies much younger than my 49 and they gave me compliments and said I was the only one and the oldest in the group that had no fillers . I was thrilled by this . After using for a month now my shin feels and looks firmer and wrinkles less noticeable, I will be buying and recommending this to all my friends .",

The email itself didn't mention to only use it 1-3 times a week, it states to use it twice a day for a month. But because it was a sample size, I used it for a few days at night followed by sunscreen the next day which is really important. I found myself breakout by the 2nd day and that might be because this retinol strength is strong that the ones I've used and my skin purged. I used it over a toner and essence and then followed it up by a night mask. I found that this serum was easy to apply, and not tacky either. It was easy to work with but I would defiantly not recommend using it twice a day everyday until your skin has build a tolerance. I would also like the know the percentage of retinol used in this product as well. Overall, it was an okay retinol product.",

It is a little oily so I decided to use mine as a nighttime ritual instead of having to apply makeup afterwards. My skin appears so much more youthful and this serum is definitely my best friend when it comes to my reality of getting older. Definitely recommend to anyone that struggles with wrinkles!",

Seeing how the serum contains hyaluronic acid, peptides and retinol, it clearly does the job it is supposed to with dealing with lines/wrinkles. Overall, my skin has improved significantly, by how it feels and looks and I believe it is best suited for my age group (50+). I would recommend this product for anyone dealing with the appearance of lines/wrinkles and does not like the heaviness of a cream or fragrance, and would rate it 10/10.",

Now after one month of applying the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum I can see a very noticeable difference in the depth of the frown lines. One in particular has greatly reduced. I will definitely purchase this product for continued use. I have maybe two days remaining in the small sample tube that I was given. I used it very sparingly as the size of the sample was very small. Because of using the product sparingly and the results that I found tells me that you don't have to apply very much to get great results. I will be letting my friends know about this product.",

There's no doubt that my skin is smoother, softer and more hydrated. Even my enlarged pores are less visible. It contains some powerful and-aging ingredients including hyaluronic acid, collagen and retinoids. I love that this serum doesn't contain any oil, denatured alcohol, SLS, SLES or sulfates. It's also fragrance, paraben and phthalate free. It's was also gentle on my mildy sensitive skin. It's super concentrated, I'm really impressed with how well it worked. Goodbye stubborn lines!",

I found I noticed more visible smoothness to my skin texture when I would exfoliate my skin prior to putting on the serum. This would definitely improve your results. i found it hard to compare the results of this serum because a lot of my wrinkles are big smile line type wrinkles. This serum will not change those big wrinkles. However, if you have some fine lines or skin texture issues, this may help you see some improvements. Not sure I personally would repurchase mainly because of the cost.",

I noticed my skin got a little flushed upon application, but that might just be from massaging it in. No negative reactions. In terms of effectiveness, I think my skin seemed brighter as retinol accelerates new skin production. In terms of reduction of wrinkles and fine lines, I would say yea to an effect; although at the same time as trying this product I was trying this in conjunction with some other Clinique creams, and the effect was noticeable; I just can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t attribute to which one!",

I am not one of those people who enjoy aging and I will not go gracefully into it, I will fight to The bitter end to give myself the self-confidence and the youth I had when I was 25 and this formula has given that to me it goes on so softly it is not oily like other products I have tried in the past it absorbs very well into the skin and I believe I have found myself a new product which gives me back my youth, my confidence and the ability to start my day loving myself, my skin and who I am as a person.",

It left my face deeply hydrated with an amazing non-greasy glow, was a great addition to my other skincare products and wore well under my buildable foundation.

It could very well be that it takes a longer time to begin working, but for this trial, I saw only a small change. The redness in my cheeks did get better and became a more normal colour.

Usually you wouldn't see results for anywhere from at least 4-6 weeks.

I was a bit sad I can't use it for the undereye area, where I have some fine lines, but since my forehead reacted, this was probably for the best. I suggest starting slowly with it, once a week in the evening only.

I used the serum five days per week. I would definitely recommend it and I will probably buy this serum because I love Clinique, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a really great brand and the products are always really wonderful. This serum is no different. I received this product for testing purposes and all opinions are my own.",

Within the first week of use, it did seem like fine lines were less noticeable and more moisturized, especially on my forehead. My skin, in general, looked more plump than usual, which gave it a younger appearance. I did make sure to avoid the eye area, although at some points, I did feel a minimal tingling sensation. It didn't last too long, which was a relief. Other than that, I didn't experience any redness or peeling at all, which can be common with retinol products. I also made sure to wear sunscreen every time I applied the serum. Overall, I really enjoyed the serum and wouldn't mind purchasing the full-sized product.",

The sample we were given to review, while generous due to fact that it was free, was only meant for a couple weeks use. That is not nearly enough time to properly review a skincare product. My opinion is solely based on what I've been able to experience in that short time. What I like about it, firstly, its has a creamy, silky texture that soaks right into the skin. It had a very light, delicate flavour and even that dissipates quickly. A little seems to go a fairly long way, so it's easy to use sparingly and therefore not empty your bank account quickly. When it comes to its clinical claims, my skin definitely feels super moisturized after use. I put it on before bed and when I wake up my skin is still dewy. Love that. Now does it minimize wrinkles? Possibly. Likely. I just cant be certain yet. Come back to me in 2 more weeks",

The next morning, my skin felt so soft, and my face did not feel dry at all, for first time in a while. I continued to use the serum, as directed on the package, twice a day, in the morning and at night. My face has never felt better, smoother, supple, moisturized! And, in addition, the brown discolorations on my skin from my time over under the hot sun of Afghanistan, appear to be fading slowly. I have always had dry skin, and when the cold weather starts, my skin always become drier. This product keeps my skin feeling healthy and soft all day and all night! Other serums would only last for half of that time. I absolutely love this serum, and would recommend it to anyone!",

I love the feel/texture of this serum and I am extremely picky and sensitive to texture and formulas on my skin. It doesn't leave you feeling sticky or anything and it doesn't pill. I definitely feel like it's very plumping/hydrating and I'm seeing good maintenance of my progress with retinol (it takes 6+ months to start seeing a different but I've used other retinol serums consistently). It does help keep acne and texture down well. I have combination skin that's acne prone and that has bouts of dehydration and oiliness. Retinol and HA help keep me consistent. I do like using this day and night and it works well with my other skincare.",

It has 3 important ingredients that make a quality anti-aging product - peptides, retinoid and hyaluronic acid, and I could see that it would work over a longer period of time, 2 weeks trial is rather short to see these types of effects. The one thing I would change would be to make it a \"clean\" product, better for the environment and for our skin. The price is a little steep, but you aren't to use it every day so it would last a long time.",

I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t say that I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve noticed much of a difference in fine lines and wrinkles, but maybe if I continue to use it I would. It doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t cause me any sensitivity or irritation which is huge plus.

But, it seemed to brighten and help even my skin tone. This Serum has a patented technology called CL1870 Laser focus complex (TM), along with retinoids and hyaluronic acids that makes a power of 3! I used it morning and night for 2 weeks, with no irritation and had less breakouts and no dry spots. It has a light floral scent, but nothing too overpowering. I would definitely recommend this product for quick results. It made my skin feel smooth and soft, and brightened me up too! My makeup went on smoothly over top of this, so no issues there. If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for a quick glow up for a special occasion, this could it!

I don't know if I would replace my current retinoid cream with this one, but I will say that I definitely look forward to buying the full size. My favorite products are always the ones that are also refreshing them they go on and this is it! I really enjoyed this trial, thank you Clinique!",

It's very easy to use, just put a bit on a clean finger and massage into your wrinkles. My skin feels moist but not greasy afterwards and I've have no issues with rashes or breakouts from the Serum. I have deep forehead wrinkles, smile lines (crows feet) and wrinkles around my mouth. I noticed my smile lines seemed to diminish first, not a huge difference just subtle changes, my forehead wrinkles seem less deep and a wee bit shorter. Around my mouth doesn't seem to have much change.

It left my skin feeling so much more smooth and hydrated than it has been in a long time. It also made my fine lines and wrinkles less obvious which is amazing! Even my husband noticed how great my skin looks and said I even look younger. Now if that isn't a great testimonial then I don't know what is!!! Now that I have tried it I will definitely continue to use it!",

I also didn't notice any particularly scent (maybe just the faintest almost floral fragrance) which is great because products with added scent can often contain drying alcohol. I don't think I've noticed much change in fine lines but I've only been using it for two weeks so possibly with long-term use those changes would happen. It's a great hydrator though and it has absolutely made my skin look brighter and more refreshed over these past 14 days.",

I applied this morning and night. This is all I could comment on with my sample I received.

Definitely made my skin soft but there's something in the serums that do not like my skin.  None of the other products i use have done this.  at this point, i think i will give up on trying any other serum.  it won't stop me from continuting to use the other products that i know have worked.",

Dark circles, big pores...I could go on all night. But this stuff has made a huge difference in the feel and look of my skin. Age spots are slowly but surely fading. I have even noticed a little improvement in my dark circles. I plan on continuing using this product and it has even inspired me to incorporate a little more self care when it comes to my skin.

I think I started to see a softening of them but as I said incould no use it religiously due to the fragrance inducted headaches.  \nI want to say it would work but I can't sat with 100% certainty.

Believe me, I have tried them all.  What's ironic is that, by coincidence, I was asked to review another wrinkle repair serum that came in a white box and a white plastic tube.  I was not impressed by this other product and was totally put off by its packaging.  The box in which it was sold was over an inch taller than the actual tube of the serum inside.  That product immediately misled me by falsely stating that there was more in the tube than there was in reality.  Clinique does nothing of the sort, as they are confident in the quality of their product.  Even at the same amount (or weight/size/volume) as its competitors, the customer is still getting more for their money.  You know the old adage, \"size doesn't matter\" is true when it comes to facial care products.  The most important characteristic of the product is that it truly works.  Clinique does work quite successfully.  Another wise statement is:  \"the best things come in small packages.\"   Clinique is clearly among the best in the facial care product category.",

        "body": "I am reviewing a wrinkle reducing and skin enhancing serum. The full name of the product is\n\"Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum\" and the brand is Clinique. In a nutshell, \"It worked. It enhanced my facial skin SOFTNESS and created a very SMOOTH skin texture and reduced to some degree the lines that I had between my eyebrows\".\n  In more detail, when I first applied it, I felt an immediate pleasurable reaction on my skin that was like \"\"scrubbing bubbles\" for lack of a better term. I was quite impressed. I kept applying it over the next few days and noticed a marked softness and smoothness to my facial skin(cheeks, forehead, etc.) that made me want to touch my own face over and over as it felt so good. \n    The substance is a liquid SERUM and it is very concentrated so that a small amount goes a long way.\n    In terms of wrinkles, I do not have any fine lines but have three vertical creases on my forehead in the area between my eyebrows. The serum caused this area to mildly plump up and thus noticeably reduced these creases, but did not remove them completely after about 10 days of use. The insert from the box says that after 16 weeks of use there is a 32% reduction in stubborn lines. \n    On a critical level it seemed to leave a fine residue on my skin that rubbed off as time went on. It is VERY concentrated, though, so use small amounts first to see what works for you.\n    In summary, the product worked well and I\nwould recommend it. I have never used any skin products like this before so I can not cross-compare it.",

This is a smooth, clear serum that absorbs well, but it does take a little bit longer than most serums to finally become ungreasy to the touch as it sinks into your skin.  But sink in it does!  Even if all the collagen-boosting claims fall through, this serum does a couple of things very well.  One is that it absorbs very well.  Two is that it is a fantastic moisturizer in itself, and I never felt the need for additional moisturizing on top of this serum.  It is so great at moisturizing that it does make your skin appear smoother by sincerely plumping your skin enough that one application got rid of my very fine crow's feet just by plumping them out!  I did not have enough time to see if there are longterm benefits of this serum, but I do like it so far!",

I used it for 2 weeks - morning and night - and here are my thoughts! \n\nAt 45 I'm pretty lucky to not really have a huge problem with wrinkles so I tried it on my forehead.  I have noticed how much smoother my forehead looks after using this for two weeks.    It wasn't a huge difference - but I can tell (see pic) which is awesome.  \n\nThe bigger thing for me personally is that I did not have an allergic reaction to this product.  I have super sensitive skin and am allergic to SO MANY things, but this actually seemed to help clear up some spots instead of creating new problems like other products I have tried in the past.  (not Clinique, but other name brands I won't mention) \n\nI would recommend trying this to anyone looking to try to minimize signs of aging.  Even if you are nervous about ingredients and reactions - I think you will be happy if you give it a shot!",

Unlike the other products this one does not break my skin out plus my skin looks really great after using it. Also it doesn't leave your skin oily like the other products I have tried. I definitely recommend buying this product if you have fine lines and wrinkles. I have recommended this product to my friends and family because of the benefits I have received from using this product. I have sensitive skin and I have had no problems with it. Works great. I am very satisfied with the results of this product.",

        "body": "Unless Clinique is claiming that their Smart Clinical Repair serum produces instant, noticeable results, its my opinion that this trial was inadequate. The amount of product to be tested , barely lasted a week when used twice daily, Its quite possible that the serum, simply put, just doesn't work. However, my experience using Clinique products throughout my lifetime, leads me to believe that it probably would work if used for a more substantial amount of time. The few conclusions I could come to were limited to the basic, initial observations made at first inspections. The odor was subtle enough to not be  bothersome. The serum has a light and smooth texture that absorbs immediately into the skin, without leaving an oily or sticky residue. The only change in my skin when using this product was a small breakout around and on my nose. I cannot say the serum caused this, as we had a nightmarish heat wave during this time and the havoc that 110\u00b0+ temps wreaks on one's skin needs no explanation.  I'm only disappointed with the anticlimactic conclusion of this experiment.  I'll keep my hopes up and my fingers crossed that the next time will be different. My suggestion to Clinique is to allow for testers to try the products for a longer period of time. My request is to develop an effective product line to treat, prevent, and conceal Melasma hyperpigmentation. It's capacity to diminish quality of life is difficult to deal with and there is little available that helps.",

        "body": "Clinique has always been a go-to skincare brand for me. Years ago when there were few options for skincare products that don't contain a lot of fragrance and dyes, Clinique was a reliable source for great products. They still are. Though there are many newer brands that can claim to be dye and fragrance-free, Clinique has the track record to back up their claims.\n \nConcerning this specific product, it is a serum meant to counteract the signs of aging on the skin. That means it will attempt to smooth lines, wrinkles, and rough patches while also minimizing the appearance of darker spots. I used this product on my face after a regime of cleansing but before I applied face lotion with SPF. It's important to use an SPF containing lotion when using serum as serum rapidly causes skin to \"refresh\" which often leaves it vulnerable to sun damage.\n\nI found this serum to be moderate. Not too harsh, so as not to completely wreck those first few layers of skin, but also not too subtle, where you have to use the serum for months to see any benefit. The skin texture seems to even out a little, and darker spots seem to blend better, and the appearance of lines shrink. \n\nAll in all, I recommend this serum if you are looking to counteract the effects of time and age. Though if you are young now I encourage you to skip needing serum and protecting your skin with a SPF lotion so you can hold out on needing serum as long as possible!",

It is a very nice consistency that makes my face feel extremely hydrated. It has a light, wonderful scent. I usually prefer unscented but this is so softly scented and is really lovely. I love the way my face feels when I apply it. It's as if my face drinks it in. It absorbs so quickly and doesn't feel oily! The hydrated feeling lasts until the next day. I only received a small sample so don't believe I have used it long enough to see results like a big difference in wrinkles. I do think I notice slightly less noticeable wrinkles, not as deep making them appear less. The huge thing I love is how hydrated and moisturized my face feels using this product. I would recommend to my family and friends. I would purchase this in the future but probably only a small bottle as it is alittle more expensive then I would like to pay. I have tried many other kinds of products such as these including Estee Lauder, 111 Skin, Sunday Riley, Verb, and Murad but really enjoyed this product. I wish the bottle had been larger so I could have gotten a longer experience using it to really see if it made a huge difference. I believe it takes at least 2-3 months to tell if it makes a dramatic difference but in the short time I have been able to try this I do believe it works, especially for moisturizing and it's great under makeup. Thank you for the opportunity to try this product!",

I've come and gone through many brands, from drugstore to high end, and Clinique always stays in my rotation. Having said that, the Smart Clinical Repair Correcting Serum is nice, particularly if you're a newb to more serious skincare. It sinks nicely into the skin. The scent is so light as to be non offensive to the vast majority of people. The serum is nicely ladeled with peptides and that old standby, hyaluronic acid, all of which does a yeoman's job of lifting an introductory regiment to the next level. I used a small container over a two-week period, and I have to say, my extremely hearty, combo skin definitely looked the better for the effort. Would I repurchase? Probably not, but not because it's not a good product, and certainly not because it's expensive (it's not for the result.) I simply have so many skincare products to try out, and one does have to do these things in a timely fashion, since all such things have a shelf life. What I would do, though, is definitely recommend this serum to friends who haven't been as fanatical as I've been about skincare. For a 'pro' like me, it's nice, but doesn't set the fireworks ablaze, but for someone who has never really invested in serious skincare, it would be a very pleasant and fruitful surprise.",

I would like to try it longer to give a more accurate review, but I was requested to write a review now. So, here it is. \n\nI feel like it does hydrate my skin. The instructions stated \"immediately\". I don't know their definition of immediately; but for me, it took a few days before I really saw any hydration.\n\nAs for minimizing fine wrinkles, I didn't notice much of a difference. The instructions stated it would take about 10 days. Maybe I didn't give it enough time. \n\nAs for minimizing deep wrinkles, there was not an opportunity to see the results for that since I had to write this review before Clinique's estimated time to see the effects of this serum.  \n\nUnfortunately, this is the best review I can give. I will continue to use this serum and update my review if there is any change. The free sample is very small so hopefully it will last me until the 16 weeks that is stated in their clinical studies to see noticeable results.",

There isnt a horrible over powering scent so I love that. Very difficult to sleep with heavily scented products on your face.

After 6 days of using both in the morning and at bedtime, I noticed that the slight lines around my eyes had started to plump and fill in!

It goes on very light and doesn't smell like anything, which is such a bonus. This doesn't irritate my sensitive skin either, which is hard to find! A little bit goes a long way because it really spreads out on your skin and I've been able to use just a few small dabs for most of my face.

It is much more moisturizing than other serums I have tried. On a hot day, I might use this alone instead of layering a moisturizer on top. It has not irritated my skin at all. My skin has been silky soft and there may be a slight difference in both my forehead lines and the lines between my eyes, but I will continue using the sample to see if there are more noticeable effects.",

        "body": "I wasn't absolutely sure how many stars to rate Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum because I didn't dislike it but I also did not like it enough to want to buy it. I only got to try on the product a handful of times before this review and maybe if I had used the product for a longer period of time it might be a little different. I might have seen more results but I didn't notice any changes.   First time using the product it has no smell which is nice, other products I've used have odd smells and this was event free and you could not tell it was on your face after applying. It didn't have a weird texture or feel cakey at all, very light. I didn't notice any fine lines get any better or disappear but again I did not use the product long enough to notice the long term results.  I did not like that you shouldn't go in the direct sun after applying, it's Summer and who's not going to go out in the sun during the day so that was also a negative to me.  I really like products that have some SPF in them because I'm older (early 40's) and I'm trying to now protect my skin vs. when I was younger and did not think of wrinkles and could care how long I tanned for.  I did not dislike the product I just wouldn't buy it personally and am glad I got to try it to determine that before I spent the money to buy.  I'm going to continue using the the remaining product I received and if I notice any changes I'll share my results if anything has changed.  I've tried a few products because I'm having issues with keeping my skin hydrated and I've got a few wrinkles and who wants to grow old and look it! I guess the question is would I buy this product and the answer is yes I probably would have to try it but would I recommend after using?!? No, I would not recommend. I say that because it didn't work for me. I didn't notice any changes, and I don't like that you should avoid sunlight after applying. But we all don't have the same skin types either and what didn't work for me might work for you.",

        "body": "I have always been a fan of Clinique and their product lines, and Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum is no exception. It lives up to its predecessors and perhaps even exceeds them in many ways. One thing I love about  Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum is that unlike many other serums, it doesn't leave the skin feeling sticky after application. It absorbs and disappears into the skin. I also like that a little goes a long way. So I feel like I am getting the luxury feel at an affordable price, another thing I love about Clinique. After my first use I woke and my skin felt soft and supple, which was fabulous. After a week of use I noticed when I applied makeup it didn't seem to settle into my fine lines and make my skin look as crepey as it had before. I also love that it doesn't have a strong smell and it feels light after application.  I will continue to use Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum and would recommend it to anyone looking to defy the effects time that inevitably show themselves in our skin. Clinique continues to knock it out of the park with Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Serum. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed.",

I haven't noticed any difference on my skin yet just because I haven't used it long enough! It felt similar to other serums I have tried however once it dries on the skin it does feel a bit tacky but once you put a moisturizer over top it feels really nice. I'm glad to have it and I think it's nice. I'm over 40 and I'm starting to experience fine lines. Need more of this  to know if it changes!",

I've used this twice a day and I could tell from the get-go that this was a great product because my skin felt moisturized and calm instead of red and dry like with other wrinkle serums.  I have noticed some subtle differences in the fine lines around my eyes and mouth with just 2 weeks of use. I can't wait to see how my skin will look after continued use.  Also, I want to note this is truly a fragrance-free product. No smell whatsoever!!  I was lucky enough to receive this product as a free sample to try out.",

My teeny lines above my lips were less noticeable. My pores got smaller & I noticed my skin tone looking healthier. Another benefit I was very glad for, it kept my face matte~ no shiny spots. That's a big win in my book! Would really like to purchase & continue using in my beauty routine but living month to month as is, blah blah.\nWould definitely recommend to others.",

There is no noticeable scent after application (there seems to be a light scent when applying).\nRegarding wrinkle treatment, I do not feel that I have used the product long enough to say if it has any long term benefits, but I will say that I have noticed that fine lines that I have, appear softer and the only two deep wrinkles that I have (frown lines on my forehead) seem less noticeable after application. This is a product that I will continue to use as I love the results so far and I truly believe that with continued use, the benefits of use will just get better.\nThis is definitely a product that i would recommend to others!",

I will continue to use this and because it's a form of retinol that my skin actually enjoys, I will purchase when this tube runs out.",

It's hydrating and contains retinoids (which you'd want in a wrinkle reducing serum). It's lightweight and spreads evenly. A little goes a long way. While I don't currently have any long term results to observe and report, I was able to finish the sample sent to me in a few days and observe the results of using it morning and night. In the short term it did leave my skin smoother and more hydrated, as you'd expect from a serum containing these products. At 42, I wouldn't say I have a ton of wrinkles, but I was able notice the plumping effect. There were no issues with irritation or clogged pores to report.\n\nThere are so many other very similar serums on the market to compare it to, though, as hyaluronic acid and retinoids are established ingredients known to work. There's nothing new or groundbreaking going on here, but this should come as close to doing what it says on the tin as is possible for a topical product. There's no wow factor or feeling that I need to rush out and buy it before finishing my current bottle of serum, but for what it is, it's a good product.",

I can tell a little difference in my wrinkles, I don't have too many or to bad, but I do notice they are less visible, which I am very happy with. I can definitely say this, I will go and purchase this. I would recommend this to everybody.

So I truly wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. Clinique did their research on skin. It comes out a white line liquid but when you rub it on your skin, It goes on like satin and does not leave your face oily. Your face is smooth and baby soft all day. when you put your foundation over it, it glides on and actually covers better. The aroma is very light and smells like a Clinique product. I would absolutely buy again and suggest to a friend.",

It smoothed over my skin like nothing I've ever felt. I absolutely love it! And I will be purchasing this product! Thank You for letting me try it and review it! This product does everything it states and more!",

Having just returned from a week-long beach vacation, right away she noticed a more hydrating feeling on her face/eye areas where she thought would be some target spots for the serum. A few days later, she could see a reduction in the prominence of some lines/wrinkles, but the stress of two children keep them coming back! \ud83d\ude09 Overall, we'll have to see what the long term results end up being, but so far a very satisfying experience for her and she will be adding this to her permanent morning routine.",

I say about another three days of using this as recommended that my dark circles will be completely gone. And it also gives you a great vibrant glowing shine that makes you look and feel 20 years younger. Also my face feels so soft and smooth and is very very hydrated and not dull and dried out anymore.

It wasn't until I started watching YouTube videos, that I found a whole world out there. But, I still have quite a few Holy Grail products that I still rotate in my routine.\u2b50\ufe0f The Clinique Custom Repair Serum has a very thick consistency, and could also be a moisturizer. I do notice my skin feels more hydrated, plump, and smooth. \ud83e\udd0dThe serum has helped with my dark spots and redness. I notice this on my fine lines on my forehead. This luxurious serum is said to visibly improve the signs of aging, such as fine lines and wrinkles.\ud83c\udfc6It's a great pick-me-up due to sleepless nights, a crazy job, and two screaming toddlers. \ud83d\udca5I usually plaster this on my face in the dead of winter when my skin feels dry and dehydrated. It does have an impressive list of beneficial ingredients such as Grapefruit, Mulberry, Barley, Cucumber, Algae, Plankton, Grape, St. Paul's Wort, Wheat, Glycerin, Rice, Whey, Sunflower, Soybean, and Squalane.\u2714\ufe0f Although it is thicker than all other serums I have tried, it does glide on the skin with ease, and absorbs quickly.\ud83d\udc8eThe product has lasted me longer than I expected it too. \u269c\ufe0fThis could be considered more than enough hydration for individuals with oily skin. Although I do enjoy this product, the serum was on the more expensive side.\ud83c\udf00 #skincare",

My skin is sensitive and usually doesn't do well with any Retinol products I've used in the past ,but Clinique uses a blend of caffeine and algae extract to help minimize irritation. So if you've been looking for a retinol that doesn't irritate you this may be your answer. \n\nI received a sample size to review so I wasn't able to use as long as I normally would love to try a product out before forming an opinion on a skincare product, but I still feel this is a great product because it didn't irritate my skin, plus it left my skin feeling so soft and plump after using the 1st day. You use in the AM & PM so it went really fast. I still noticed that my skin was more plump and glowing. I love that it's fragrance free,as much as I love fragrance , it's best not to have fragrance in your skincare. I really wish the sample was bigger to see more results,but I still would recommend because of the fact it didn't irritate my skin and I love the way my skin feels and looks after using. I love Clinique and the products I've used in the past has shown results and I will continue to purchase from them. The purple packaging is really nice as well. \nAlways use SPF with this product! \nI received this sample for free for my honest review.",

My middle-aged skin tends towards dryness, and I have mild rosacea, which can make for a rough texture on my nose, so finding products that treat wrinkles that my skin will both tolerate and absorb can be a challenge.  The Smart Clinical Repair serum has a nice texture, not too heavy and my skin definitely absorbed it well.  My skin was left feeling soft, but not greasy.  My daily sunscreen/moisturizer went on easily over it. I could even see using it as a primer for foundation because it makes my skin feel so smooth.\n\nThe serum gives my skin a little bit of reflectiveness, so right away the look of some of my finer lines were minimized, which was a nice instant ego boost.  Ten days in, I do think some of the finer lines look fainter, and the texture of my skin is definitely improved.  I wouldn't say it improves my skin redness, but it's definitely not making it worse, which again, for rosacea skin, is a win.  It's definitely gentle; I haven't had any tingling or stinging.  Overall it's a good product and I look forward to seeing what my skin looks like a month into using it!",

I'm also noticing my wrinkles are less noticable. In time I think they'll become even more less noticable. It's easy to apply, just squeeze a tiny amount (that's why I say a little goes a long ways) in the palm of your hand and apply it twice daily to clean skin, then apply CLINIQUE moisturizer of your choice and top it off with sunscreen, be cautious and limit being in the sun while using and a week after as it states on the packaging. Overall I'm ecstatic with the results I'm seeing while using this product and am glad I've incorporated it into my skincare rou",

I have dry skin with lines on my forehead and mouth. This serum that I used over 5 days really diminished the appearance of these lines. The texture of the serum is silky and it absorbs onto the skin easily. I loved how it kept my skin hydrated and silky soft for hours. I woke up looking freshed and rested. I felt it really also helped with my dryness and my skin felt pumped and hydrated. I really loved this serum and would definately recommend it.",
